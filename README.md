# First proposal

# Project Title : 
Urban Sound Classification and its response to gunshot sound using the implementation of Deep Neural Networks

# Project Idea Description:
From the past few years, this has been observed that Artificial Intelligence has progressed into the medium of sound also. This idea has been taken and the implementation is to classify and identify maximum possible urban sounds. This will be done by utilizing the difference in frequency, intensity and wavelength. It can be used to plot a spectrograph and a mel-spectrogram would be utilized to identify the pattern of sound. The major aspect here is to identify the gunshot sound and report it immediately to the concerned authorities for quick action.

# Goals of the project:
To classify and identify the urban sounds and take immediate action on hearing the gunshot sound.

# Technology Stack:
•	Deep CNN to classify the sound.
•	Log scaled mel-spectrogram to observe time frequency patches.
•	Python 
•	Keras
•	Librosa for analysis of audio signals.
